                Hi! I'm Nicky Toth, I have a huge creativity push when it comes to anything I work on.

                    <p>I love to 3D model. It's been a hobby of mine for a long time now, and I completely self-taught myself how to do it.</p>

                <p>
                    I lived in Wisconsin my whole life. When I was little, I didn't get to go out much, so I fixated on technology.
                    I started learning how to code via school and began 3D modeling around 2021, becoming really good at it through self-teaching.
                    Using a program called Blender, I found it hard at first, but I kept at it, and now I can make anything I want in 3D.
                    I'm not just a computer geekâ€”I love many things, like animals. I once had 5 cats! Currently, I have a Golden Lab named Ruby.
                    I hope to make something interesting and spread my talent and ideas through my vision.
